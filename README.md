# Motivation

### <ins>What</ins> is the problem?
Due to the lucractive and competitive nature to obtain a limited pair of sneakers. Many
sneakerbots exist in the market. Not all sites are supported by a single sneakerbot and some bots have better results
for certain sites than other bots. Hence, it is normal to run multiple bots for a single drop. 

However, micromanaging multiple bots at the same time can be time-consuming and even stressful. There should be a tool 
which allows the same tasks and profiles to be synchronized on different bots. 

### <ins>How</ins> does Ch3f Jordan solve this problem?
Ch3f API is a management tool to synchornize billing profiles across different bots. There is only one frontend to 
manage, which is user-friendly. Any changes made will be updated to all active bots. No more micromanaging multiple bots.

### <ins>Who</ins> might use Ch3f Jordan?
If you are a sneakerbot user with multiple bots, Ch3f Jordan will make it easier to manage your tasks and profiles.

### <ins>When</ins> will Ch3f Jordan be ready to use?
The planned timeline is a public beta by the end of Q2 2021, and followed by a full release at the end of Q4 2021.
